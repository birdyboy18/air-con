## Instructions

Welcome to Air Con.

In this sessions we will be using the wise knowledge of Nicolas Cage to learn how we can provide better semantic content.

In the infinite knowledge that is Nicolas Cage we will also learn the common hacks and newer ways in which we can make layouts with more ease.

### Play along

If you want to, and if you have your own laptops, then please download, or clone this repo (It's up to you). Unzip it, open it in a browser and then follow along as best you can as we talk about how Nicolas Cage has enlightened us.


#### Technical Stuffs

If you are going to code along as we do it. Then me (Paul) will be using the sass to write and compile into normal CSS. If you know what this is, and know how to compile it then simply watch the css folder for changes and it will all compile into a style.css.

If you don't use SASS at all then feel free to just edit and use the style.css. It will still work because the index.html is simply linking to the style.css anyways.
